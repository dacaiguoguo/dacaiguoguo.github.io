            <p>Heromind Holdings Limited LLC (“we” or “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy
                Policy outlines our data protection policies and describes the types of information we may process when
                you install and/or use the AI Headshot Generator software application (“the App”, “our App”) on your
                mobile device. The name of the App may vary outside the United States and is subject to change without
                notice.</p>
            <p>When we refer to personal data (or personal information), we mean any type of information related to an
                identifiable natural person, especially by referring to such data. It is information related to a
                natural person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, particularly through reference to an
                identifier such as a social security number or one or more factors specific to the physical,
                physiological, psychological, economic, cultural, or social identity of that person. Our Privacy Policy
                applies to all users and others who access the App.</p>
            <p>In terms of GDPR, we are data controllers, unless otherwise stated.</p>

            <p>We do not sell any of your personal data, except as outlined in Section Four below.</p>
        </section>


        <h2>Please read the following privacy policy carefully to understand how your personal information may be
            processed. By using the App, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these
            terms.</h2>

        <h2>II. Information We Process</h2>
        <p>Several categories of information can be processed.</p>
        <p>Automated Processing of Information</p>
        <p>With your permission, we use third-party automated data processing technologies (advertising or analytics
            tools) to analyze certain information sent by your device via our App (advertiser ID for iOS devices/Ad ID
            or Android ID for Android devices). Some integrated advertising or analytics tools (please refer to Section
            Four for a list) initiate automated processing of your personal data, including analysis, which means any
            form of automated processing of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects related to you,
            particularly analysis or prediction of aspects concerning your personal preferences, interests, behavior,
            location, or movements (please refer to the data list described below). Once you allow our App to track your
            activities, information processing automatically starts through automated data processing technologies. You
            can withdraw your permission at any time - please see the opt-out options in Section VIII below.</p>
        <p>We may process some information about your device and user behavior based on our legitimate interest. This
            information belongs to the data categories described in the “Automated Processing of Information” section
            above and is usually non-personal, meaning it does not allow direct association with any specific
            individual, and we can only access it in aggregated form. We use this information to improve our App and
            provide the best experience for our users.</p>
        <p>Device Details When you access our App using a mobile device (tablet/phone/smartwatch), the system reports
            certain details about your device, including a “device identifier”. A device identifier is a small data file
            or similar data structure stored on or associated with your mobile device, uniquely identifying your mobile
            device (but not you personally). Device identifiers support third parties in generic reporting or
            personalized content and advertisements.</p>
        <p>Data That Can Be Processed Information about the device itself: device type, operating system type and
            version, model and manufacturer, screen size, screen density, orientation, volume and battery, device memory
            usage. Information about the internet connection: mobile carrier, network provider, network type, IP
            address, timestamps and session duration, speed, browser. Location-related information: IP address,
            country/region/state/city code associated with your SIM card or device, language settings, time zone,
            proximity to commercial points of interest (e.g., “coffee shop”). Other device identifiers: such as user
            identifiers (if set by the app developers). Information about the application: Our app’s name, API key
            (application identifier), version, attributes, for automated processing and analysis. Some services also
            record a list of applications and/or processes installed or running on your device.</p>
        <p>Cookies and Similar Technologies When you use the App, cookies and similar technologies (pixels, web beacons,
            scripts) may be used. Cookies are small text files containing a small amount of information downloaded to
            your device when you visit the App. Each time you use the App, the text file is sent back to the server.
            This enables us to operate the App more effectively. For example, we will understand how many users access
            specific areas or features of our App and which links or ads they click on. We use this aggregated
            information to understand and optimize how our App is used, improve our marketing efforts, and provide
            content and features that interest you. We may request advertisers or other partners to provide ads or
            services to the App, which may use cookies or similar technologies.</p>
        <p>Log File Information Log file information is automatically reported each time you request access to the App.
            It can also be provided when the App is installed on your device. When you use our App, analysis tools
            automatically log certain information, including the date and time you start and stop using the App, and how
            you interact with it.</p>
        <p>Advertising-Related Information Data about ads you may view can be reported: the date and time a particular
            ad was delivered; records of whether the ad was “clicked” or shown as a “conversion” event; what the content
            of the ad offer was; what type of ad it was (e.g., text, image, or video); which ad placement was involved
            (where the ad offer appeared within the App); whether you responded to the ad.</p>
        <p>In-App Events When you use our App, analysis tools automatically log information about your activities
            (tutorial steps, upgrades, payments, in-app purchases, custom events, progress) events, limiting methods of
            user data processing). Information automatically provided to advertising or analysis tools is generally
            beyond our control, and therefore we are not responsible for the processing of such information. Note that
            some services involving personal data analysis may obtain information related to your personality and/or
            your device using technologies not under our responsibility. If your user ID is linked to your Facebook
            account, Facebook may combine your device information with categorized data recorded in its database (e.g.,
            your age, gender, or other demographic indicators). We do not control, oversee, or guarantee how third
            parties process your personal data, which may be collected by them in their own ways (not through our App).
            Any requests for information disclosure about your personal data should be made directly to such third
            parties (see Section Four).</p>
        <p>Payment Information Our e-commerce providers (Apple / Google) are responsible for billing, processing, and
            charging for in-app purchases, handling your personal information, and ensuring its absolute security. This
            information is processed as part of fulfilling the contract between you and us. We do not have access to or
            use your credit card or debit card information. You can access applicable "in-app" purchase rules and
            policies directly from the app store.</p>
        </section>
        <h2>III. Purpose for Processing Your Personal Data</h2>
        <section>
            <h2>Face Data Policy</h2>
            <h3>• We do not collect Face data</h3>
            <p>We analyze your photos to find the feature points of the faces in the photos (eg eyes, nose, mouth
                points) for face processing. We do not collect facial data. After the analysis process, all data will be
                deleted and no data will be saved.</p>
            <h3>• Purpose and process of collecting face data</h3>
            <p>In order to give you the "face swap" effect, we need to find feature points (e.g. eyes, nose, mouth
                points).</p>
            <p>The complete process is: (1) You submit the selected photo to our server in an encrypted way; (2) The
                server analyzes the face data in your photo and applies it to the template you choose; (3) After the
                composition is completed, the server returns the final rendering effect to you through the
                application;(4) The final composite effect will be temporarily stored in encrypted storage, and will be
                permanently deleted after a certain period of time. After the compositing process is complete, we will
                delete the face image you submitted to the server immediately.</p>
            <h3>• Face data sharing and storage</h3>
            <p>We will not share your face data with any third party, nor will we store any face information you submit,
                and the photos you upload will be deleted after the analysis process is complete.</p>
        </section>


        <h2>Our mission is to continually improve our App and provide you with new experiences. As part of this mission,
            we use your information for the following purposes:</h2>

            our terms of use.</p>

        <h2>IV. Sharing Your Information</h2>
        <p>We share your information with third parties only as described in this Privacy Policy. We adhere to the
            self-regulatory principles for the mobile environment of the Digital Advertising Alliance in the USA.</p>
        <p>Please note, when integrating external services, we select third-party organizations that can ensure they
            adopt all necessary technical and organizational measures to protect user personal data. However, we cannot
            guarantee the security of any information transmitted to any such third party. We are not responsible for
            any accidental loss or unauthorized access to your personal data due to the fault of third parties.</p>
        <p>We may share your information with third-party organizations providing automatic data processing technology
            for our App, such as information from log files, device identifiers, and location data. We do not control or
            influence these third parties' tracking technologies or how they are used.</p>
        <p>We may also share certain information with third-party advertising partners, such as cookie data. This
            information enables third-party ad networks to deliver targeted ads they believe will be of most interest to
            you.</p>
        <p>We may engage the following third-party service providers to provide infrastructure needed for delivery and
            improvement of services:</p>

        <p>For more information about these services and their privacy options (including opt-out), please refer to
            their respective websites and privacy policies. We are not responsible for any third-party's misuse of your
            personal data contrary to our instructions.</p>
        <p>Our App may contain links to third-party websites/services or be accessible from third-party websites. We are
            not responsible for the privacy practices of these third-party websites or services linked to our App,
            including the information or content contained within them.</p>
        <p>In cases of objective necessity, public interest, or other unforeseeable circumstances, we may disclose your
            personal information:</p>
        <p>As required by law;</p>
        <p>When we sincerely believe disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, your safety or the safety of others,

            well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</p>
        <h2>V. International Data Transfer</h2>
        <p>We offer our App to users around the world. Our third-party organizations that provide automatic data
            processing technology for the App or our third-party advertising partners may transfer the information
            processed automatically across borders, from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or
            jurisdictions worldwide.</p>
        <p>If you are located in the European Union or other regions where laws governing data processing may differ
            from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country
            and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>This means your personal information may be transferred to a third country, a territory or one or more
            specified sectors within that third country, or an international organization where data protection and
            privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection for personal data as in your country.</p>
        <p>We strive to ensure that any recipient of personal data provides suitable protection for such data in
            accordance with current legislation governing the protection of such information. By using the App, you
            consent to the transfer of your personal data to anythird country, a territory or one or more specified
            sectors within that third country, or an international organization.</p>
        <p>For data storage purposes, we resort to the services of hosting organizations. We take your privacy
            seriously, therefore, where possible, we encrypt your personal data before sending it to hosting
            organizations for storage. Please note that we only collaborate with hosting organizations that have passed
            our security and reliability checks..</p>
        <h2>VI. Exercising Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Applicable data protection law grants you certain rights regarding your personal information. With respect to
            your personal information, you have the following choices:</p>
        <p>Data Access and Portability: You may request a copy of your personal information.</p>
        <p>Change or Correct Data: If you cannot update the data yourself through your account, you have the right to
            request correction, update, or rectification of your data.</p>
        <p>Data Retention and Deletion: User data is generally retained as long as your user profile exists or as needed
            to provide relevant services. However, the specific retention period may vary depending on the context of
            the processing performed. You have the right to request deletion of all or part of your personal data that
            we hold.</p>
        <p>Restriction on Processing: In certain circumstances, you may have the right to restrict the ways in which
            your personal information is used.</p>
        <p>Objection to Processing: In certain circumstances, you may object to the automatic processing of your
            personal information. If your personal information is processed for direct marketing purposes, you may
            request to stop processing your data for these direct marketing purposes. To exercise your rights, contact
            the third-party services listed in Section IV to learn how to object to the processing of your data. Most of
            them have clear instructions on their privacy pages, functionality APIs, or other options.</p>
        <h2>VII. Security</h2>
        <p>The security of your personal information is of utmost importance to us. We follow generally accepted
            industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we
            receive it.</p>
        <p>Considering the risks involved in the processing and the nature of personal information, we take reasonable
            and appropriate measures to protect personal information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access,
            disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p>
        <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures aimed at effectively implementing data
            protection principles, such as data minimization, and integrating necessary safeguards into the processing.
            We seek to use appropriate and robust encryption algorithms (including hashing where possible) to encrypt
            your personal data.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
            While we strive to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Should your
            personal information be compromised due to a breach of security, we will notify you immediately in
            accordance with applicable law.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions about the security of our App, you can contact us using the email or contact form
            displayed below.</p>
        <h2>VIII. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy will be updated regularly. Whenever we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post
            those changes to this Privacy Policy and other places we deem appropriate. Depending on the circumstances,
            we may provide additional forms of notice of modifications or updates.</p>
